:::

# Internet

- The venue might not provide a Wi-Fi signal with internet, in which case, we need to use mobile internet.
  - AIS mobile network has stronger signal than Dtac inside the building.

# Video

- HDMI input at the left of the stage.
- The stage has an LED screen.
  - The screen is very bright, so dark-themed presentations are recommended.
    - If speaker’s video signal is processed through OBS, we can apply a filter to decrease the brightness.
  - The screen has a 21:9 aspect ratio, 16:9 video signal will be stretched.
    - If speaker’s video signal is processed through OBS, we can stretch the video to 1463x1080 to cancel out the stretching.

# Audio

- A [mixer](https://usa.yamaha.com/files/download/other_assets/6/331296/ql5_en_om_b0.pdf) is provided by the venue. XLR output from the venue’s mixer is available at the left of the stage. Livestreaming crew can use that signal for live streaming.
- Wireless microphones are provided by the venue. Each mic needs 2 AA batteries, which can last for 2-3 hours. Organizers should buy spare batteries in case batteries run out.
