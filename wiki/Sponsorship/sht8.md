# 🤝 Calling for Sponsors - Stipud Honkatack in Thailand 888

## What is The Stupid Hackathon?

**The Stupid Hackathon in Thailand** is a unique, collaborative event where innovation meets pure fun. Unlike traditional hackathons, this one has no competitive edge and no emphasis on business value. It is all about unleashing creativity and enjoying the process of making something outlandish and entertaining.

Our main goal is simple: we want makers to *have fun* and learn together. Whether it is creating “seal” programming language, hilarious solution for zoom, or nothing…, participants can work on any project they dream of. It is about fostering a community of enthusiastic creators who enjoy the journey of building and experimenting.

Whether a developer, a designer, or an aspiring hacker from whatever-background with crazy, stupid, or crazy-stupid ideas and an itch for experimentation, we welcome you to join the most ridiculous hackathon ever held to date.

The Stupid Hackathon is a global phenomenon, [held in cities all around the world](https://gist.github.com/cheeaun/c3fe6cbb11aef1e146a3474dccf63b87). From its origins in New York to vibrant events in San Francisco, Rhode Island, Canada, the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Norway, Hawaii, the UK, Shanghai, Singapore, and now, right here in Thailand! Staying true to the spirit of these global gatherings, our event is completely *non-commercial* and free for everyone to attend.
