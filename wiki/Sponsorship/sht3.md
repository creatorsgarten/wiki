**The Stupid Hackathon Thailand** is a 2-day collaborative hackathon in Thailand with no competition or focus on business value whatsoever.

Our main goal for this hackathon is to get developers to just *have fun* and learn together, through working on any project they want, fostering a community of enthusiastic makers.

This hackathon is [held all around the world](https://gist.github.com/cheeaun/c3fe6cbb11aef1e146a3474dccf63b87), including New York (the original), San Francisco, Rhode Island, Canada, Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Norway, Hawaii, UK, Shanghai, Singapore, and… here, Thailand!
