# Monetary budgeting

**Note:** Venue price is not included since based on initial feedback, there are potential venue owners who are willing to support us, not by monetary means, but by letting us use their venue for free.

**Note:** This event is non-commercial.

**3****0,000 THB ‚Äî Minimum viable stupid hackathon (ACHIEVED!)**

    - Food
    - Snacks
    - Drinks
    - Basic name tags
    - Accessories, such as pens, papers, markers, boards, post-its, garbage bag, etc.

**50,000 THB ‚Äî Make it more awesome and memorable (ACHIEVED!)**
