- **Inventory tracking** ({% render 'Person', name: 'dtinth' %}, {% render 'Person', name: 'rayriffy' %}): Building the tool and produce labels so we can identify which equipments belong to Creatorsgarten and which are not.

- **Event photos**: {% render 'Person', name: 'faypichaya' %} raised an issue about event photos management “รูปอีเว้นในงานนี่ทีมเรามีวิธีเก้บอะไรมั้ย หรือโยนเข้าไดฟ์ปกติเลย”. Maybe we should consolidate the public event photos so people can find the photos of past events.

- **Image management** ({% render 'Person', name: 'dtinth' %}): ~~I am thinking about image hosting solutions, right now images are hosted on GitHub / Discord / Thai’s R3 bucket.~~ I built a system to upload images to Cloudinary after got inspired from talking with Cloudinary people at CityJS Singapore. However, this system is not integrated with our wiki editor yet.

- **Wiki editor** ({% render 'Person', name: 'rayriffy' %}): Riffy has an idea for improving the editor using [Plate JS](https://platejs.org/).
