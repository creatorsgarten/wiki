As a **wiki editor**, you can use the edit wiki pages directly on this website, without having to send pull requests to our {% render 'GitHub', repo: 'creatorsgarten/wiki' %} repository.

When to use the web editor:

- When you want to make quick changes to the wiki page.
- When you are on-the-go (e.g. on a mobile device).
