Before you can edit wiki pages, you need to join the Creatorsgarten team on GitHub.
:::

Make sure that:
- You're already logged in.
- You have connected your GitHub account in your profile.

Joining the GitHub organization is the final step to get full editing permissions.

## How to Join the GitHub Organization

1. **Submit a pull request** to add your GitHub username to the [`index.ts` file in our configuration repository](https://github.com/creatorsgarten/configuration/blob/main/index.ts). This file contains a list of all team members' GitHub usernames. You'll need to add yours to this list.

2. **Wait for approval** - Once your pull request has been reviewed and merged, you will receive an invitation to join the Creatorsgarten GitHub organization.

3. **Accept the invitation** - Check your GitHub notifications or email for the invitation and accept it.

4. **You're in!** - Once you've accepted the invitation, you'll be able to edit wiki pages and contribute to all our projects. Welcome to Creatorsgarten!

   **‚è∞ Important:** Due to caching, you may need to wait up to **5 minutes** after joining the team before you can edit wiki pages. If you see a "read-only" message when trying to edit, please wait a few minutes and try again.
