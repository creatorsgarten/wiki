Our [event pages](/events) feature a list of contributors for each event. If you have a public profile on our [[people]] page, your profile will also show which events you have contributed to.

This system is relatively new, so the information can be incomplete, especially for older events. If you notice your information missing from an event’s contributor list, you can add yourself by following the instructions below.

# How to Add Yourself as an Event Contributor

If you contributed to an event but your picture is missing from the contributor list, you can add yourself by following these steps:

1. **Create a Public Profile**

   - Make sure you have a public profile on our wiki. Your name should be listed on our [[People]] page. If you don’t have a profile yet, see [[People#creating-a-public-profile|creating a public profile]].

2. **Add Yourself as a Contributor (Choose One Option Below)**

   - There are two ways to add yourself to the event contributor list:
     - [Edit the event page yourself](#option-1-edit-the-event-page-yourself): This self-service method is best for minor updates or if you only need to add yourself to a few events.
     - [Request a bulk update](#option-2-request-a-bulk-update): If you have contributed to several events, you can use this option to update all your contributions at once.

## Option 1: Edit the Event Page Yourself

- Go to the event page you contributed to.
- Click the "Edit this page" link at the top of the page.
- In the page’s YAML front matter, add your username to the appropriate section (such as `leads`, `staff`, or `speakers`). These are lists of usernames.
- Save the page. Your name should appear in the contributor list after a few minutes (due to caching).

## Option 2: Request a Bulk Update

If you have contributed to multiple events in the past, editing each event page one by one can be quite tedious. To make this easier, we have a form you can submit for a bulk update, and we will help you update your information:
