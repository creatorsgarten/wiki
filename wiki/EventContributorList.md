# How to Add Yourself as an Event Contributor

If you contributed to an event but your picture is missing from the contributor list, you can add yourself by following these steps:

1. **Create a Public Profile**

   - Make sure you have a public profile on our wiki. Your name must be listed on the [[People]] page. If you don’t have a profile yet, see [[People#creating-a-public-profile|creating a public profile]].

2. **Edit the Event Page**

   - Go to the event page you contributed to.
   - Click the "Edit this page" link at the top of the page.
   - In the page’s YAML front matter, add your username to the appropriate section (such as `leads`, `staff`, or `speakers`). These are lists of usernames.
   - Save the page. Your name should appear in the contributor list after a few minutes (due to caching).

## Troubleshooting

- If your name or picture does not appear after editing, please wait a few minutes for the cache to update.
- If you have trouble editing the page or need help, you can ask for assistance in [our GitHub Discussions help category](https://github.com/orgs/creatorsgarten/discussions/categories/help).
