title: Managing events with MC/OD
---

:::lead
**The MC/OD system** is a flat organizational structure used for managing volunteer-based events, like hackathons. It was developed to promote flexibility, distributed leadership, hands-on learning, and equal participation. The system emphasizes that "everyone is a worker and everyone is a boss," removing traditional hierarchical barriers.
:::

- **MC** (Master of Ceremony) or **DRI** (Directly Responsible Individual): Each MC (or DRI) acts as the lead or facilitator for a specific aspect of the event, like logistics, food, or sponsorships. For more information, see the [MC](#mc) section.
- **OD** (One-Day Director): The OD serves as the ultimate decision-maker for a single day of the event, providing focused leadership and ensuring alignment with the overall event goals. The OD sets the tone for the day, makes real-time decisions, and resolves any issues that might arise. For more information, see the [OD](#od) section.

# Politics of event management

While seemingly unusual, applying a political lens to event management helps understand the power dynamics at play:

- **People:** The core participants, including staff, volunteers, and attendees.
- **Policy:** The established guidelines, rules, and desired outcomes for the event.
- **Power:** The decision-making authority and influence within the system.

Recognizing these elements is crucial as they directly impact the event's success. As noted by YCC101 participants, "politics is all around" - political dynamics are present in any group where two or more people work together, and acknowledging this reality helps create more equitable systems.

# Core principles of the MC/OD system

The MC/OD system is built on several foundational principles that distinguish it from traditional hierarchical management:

## Rights and Power

- **Rights (สิทธิ์)**: These are inherent to everyone in the system and cannot be taken away. The three fundamental rights in MC/OD are Voice, Vote, and Work.
- **Power (อำนาจ)**: Unlike rights, power is granted by others. In the MC/OD system, power comes in two forms:
  - **Hard Power**: Authority based on position or role
  - **Soft Power**: Influence based on persuasion, expertise, or social capital

## Trust, Train, and Consult

The system operates through three interconnected principles:

- **Trust**: Team members trust each other to take on responsibilities and complete tasks.
- **Train**: Everyone receives training for their roles and is encouraged to learn new skills.
- **Consult**: Those with experience offer guidance to newcomers without taking over.

This approach enables people to volunteer for roles outside their comfort zone, knowing they'll receive support without being judged or micromanaged.

# Voice, Vote, Work

The MC/OD system emphasizes three core tenets that form the foundation of democratic participation:

- **Voice (เสียง)**: Everyone has the right to express ideas, concerns, and suggestions freely without fear of judgment or being burdened with implementation. Key aspects:

  - No one should be criticized for sharing ideas, even if they seem impractical
  - Speaking up doesn't obligate you to implement the idea
  - All voices are collected and considered equally
  - As participants noted, the system encourages people to "be brave and speak what you think"

- **Vote (โหวต)**: Democratic decision-making where all participants have equal say. The system includes two approaches:

  - **Standard voting**: Majority-based decision making
  - **Ratification (รับรอง)**: Unanimous consensus required - if even one person objects, the proposal must be reconsidered

  This ensures decisions are truly acceptable to everyone, avoiding situations where marginalized views are overridden.

- **Work (งาน)**: Converting ideas into action through a volunteer-based approach:
  - Tasks are listed based on the approved ideas
  - People volunteer for tasks they're interested in
  - Everyone contributes according to their capacity and interest
  - Responsibility is shared among all who voted for the idea

This cycle of Voice-Vote-Work creates a system where participants are empowered at every stage, from ideation to implementation.

# MC

**MCs** (Master of Ceremony), sometimes also called **[[DRI]]s**, are responsible for specific areas or tasks within the event. The role is defined by three key principles:

## Volunteer-Based Leadership

MCs are not appointed based on expertise but through voluntary self-nomination. As YCC101 participants noted:

- Anyone can volunteer to be an MC for any area, regardless of prior experience
- No special qualifications are required - just willingness to learn and coordinate
- This approach encourages people to step outside their comfort zones

## Responsibilities of an MC

MCs serve as coordinators rather than direct executors:

- Gather input and ideas from all participants (Voice)
- Present collected ideas to the group for voting/ratification
- Create task lists based on approved plans
- Find volunteers for each task
- Monitor overall progress and maintain the big picture
- Use veto power (if necessary) to make critical decisions while taking personal responsibility

## The "No Direct Work" Principle

One of the most distinctive aspects of being an MC is the rule that **MCs should not execute tasks themselves**. This principle:

- Prevents MCs from imposing their personal preferences on the work
- Ensures they maintain objectivity in coordinating efforts
- Keeps them focused on the overall progress rather than specific details
- Forces delegation and knowledge sharing
- Creates opportunities for others to participate and learn

As one participant explained: "The MC is forbidden from doing the work themselves. They must only observe others, distribute tasks, and accept voices to redistribute to others."

# OD

The **OD** (One-Day Director) provides high-level direction and coordination for each event day. While the YCC101 notes focus more on the MC role, the OD plays a crucial complementary function in the system:

- Sets the overall vision and goals for the event day
- Ensures coherence between different MC-led areas
- Has veto power over decisions if absolutely necessary
- Facilitates communication among MCs
- Resolves conflicts or overlapping responsibilities
- Makes time-sensitive decisions when needed

The OD role rotates among experienced team members, ensuring fresh perspectives while maintaining continuity throughout multi-day events.

# Key features

The MC/OD system offers several distinctive characteristics that set it apart from traditional organizational structures:

- **Flat hierarchy:** No fixed departments, permanent leadership roles, or supervisor-subordinate relationships
- **Flexibility:** Participants can take on multiple roles as needed, serving as an MC in one area while volunteering in others
- **Shared responsibility:** Every member acts as both a leader and a follower, fostering a sense of ownership and collective accountability
- **Learning focus:** Inexperienced volunteers are encouraged to take on new responsibilities with support from those with more experience
- **Trust-based:** Relies on mutual trust rather than top-down control
- **Adaptability:** The system is highly adaptable and can be tailored to fit the specific needs of each event
- **Transparency:** Regular all-hands meetings and open communication ensure everyone stays informed
- **Appreciation-oriented:** As noted by participants, the system emphasizes expressing gratitude to reinforce equality and recognize contributions

# MC/OD in practice: A simulation example

During YCC101, participants experienced a practical demonstration of the MC/OD system through a simulation focused on creating a "Merit Points" (แต้มบุญ) system. The process followed these steps:

## 1. Topic selection

The group decided to work on a merit points system for the camp.

## 2. Objective setting (Voice)

Everyone shared their ideas about the purpose of the merit points:

- To motivate participation in activities
- To serve as a currency within the camp
- To create friendly competition
- To exchange for rewards

## 3. Modeling (Voice → Vote)

Various implementation ideas were proposed:

- Stickers on name tags
- Scoreboard system
- RPG application with level progression
- Health bar visualization (ranking based on bar length)

Through voting and ratification, the group selected the most suitable approach.

## 4. Task distribution (Work)

Tasks were identified and volunteers stepped up to handle different aspects of the implementation.

## 5. Additional suggestions

The process remained open to new ideas, such as:

- Adding a "demerit points" system
- Including bonus points

This practical example demonstrates how the MC/OD system facilitates collaborative decision-making while ensuring that everyone's voice is heard and considered, resulting in a solution that the entire group supports.

# Participant reflections

YCC101 participants shared valuable perspectives about their experience with the MC/OD system, offering insights into its impact on individuals and teams:

## Transformative experiences

Many participants described the system as eye-opening, revealing alternatives to traditional leadership structures:

- "This opened my world and taught me about new work systems like MC/OD that I never knew before."
- "I used to think my own working style was good and fair to everyone, but there's so much more I didn't know."
- "I was surprised that the system doesn't require anyone to be the leader - work can still proceed systematically."

## Breaking comfort zones

The system encouraged people to try new roles and responsibilities:

- "I'm someone who doesn't usually dare to speak to large groups, but this helped me step out of my comfort zone."
- "I wasn't confident at first as a note-taker, afraid I wouldn't be able to keep up, but when I actually tried, I understood what needed to be done."
- "The system gives you opportunities to try things you're interested in but aren't yet skilled at."

## Equality and appreciation

Participants valued the emphasis on equality and mutual respect:

- "I liked how everyone thanks each other constantly to demonstrate equality."
- "The warm welcome from the seniors makes it feel like a community rather than just a camp."
- "Everyone has equal rights, and every voice matters."

# Benefits of the MC/OD system

Beyond the structural aspects, participants highlighted several key benefits of implementing this system:

## Distributed knowledge and skills

- Prevents knowledge silos where only one person understands a critical aspect
- Creates opportunities for learning across different areas
- Builds a more resilient team that can handle absences or transitions

## Enhanced engagement and ownership

- People choose roles they're interested in rather than being assigned tasks
- Volunteers take greater responsibility for areas they've chosen
- Increased motivation through autonomy and purpose

## Fairer decision-making

- Multiple perspectives are considered before decisions are made
- Unanimous consent ensures solutions work for everyone
- Prevents powerful personalities from dominating the process

## Community building

- Creates bonds across traditional boundaries like experience level or expertise
- Emphasizes mutual support rather than competition
- Builds long-term relationships beyond single events

# Conclusion

The MC/OD system represents more than just an organizational structure; it embodies a philosophy of collaborative leadership, shared responsibility, and continuous learning. While initially developed for event management, its principles can be applied to various contexts, from student activities to community projects and beyond.

As one participant reflected: "This isn't just about organizing an event—it's about creating a community where everyone can express their ideas and develop their abilities to contribute to society."

The system's emphasis on voice, vote, and work creates a framework where leadership becomes accessible to all, regardless of experience or position, and where collective wisdom guides decision-making. This approach not only produces successful events but also nurtures future leaders who understand the value of collaboration, democratic processes, and distributed responsibility.
