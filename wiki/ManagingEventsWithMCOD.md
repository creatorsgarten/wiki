**The MC/OD system** is a flat organizational structure used for managing volunteer-based events, like hackathons. It was developed to promote flexibility, distributed leadership, and hands-on learning.

# Voice, Vote, Work

These are considered the basic rights and responsibilities of staff and volunteers in the MC/OD system:

- **Voice:** The right to express opinions, ideas, and concerns
  - Encourages open communication
  - Ensures all perspectives are considered
- **Vote:** The right to participate in decision-making processes
  - Can involve formal voting or consensus-building
  - Promotes buy-in and shared ownership
- **Work:** The responsibility to contribute actively to the event
  - Involves taking on specific tasks or roles
  - Ensures that decisions are followed through with action

# MC

**MCs**, sometimes also called **[[DRI]]s**, are responsible for specific areas or tasks within the event. Anyone can become an MC, regardless of prior experience. MCs:

- Collect input from other participants
- Propose plans and decisions for their area
- Delegate tasks to volunteers
- Report progress to the OD

# OD

The **OD** provides high-level direction and coordination on each day. They:

- Set the overall vision and goals for the event
- Delegate authority to MCs for different areas
- Have veto power over decisions if needed
- Facilitate communication between MCs

# Key Principles

- **Flat hierarchy** - No fixed departments or permanent leadership roles
- **Flexibility** - Participants can take on multiple roles as needed
- **Learning focus** - Inexperienced volunteers are encouraged to take on new responsibilities
- **Consensus-driven** - Decisions aim for agreement from all, not just majority rule
- **Transparency** - Regular all-hands meetings and open communication

:::details[Old draft]

In this model, multiple Master of Ceremonies (MCs) take on different responsibilities and aspects of the event or camp, with each MC managing and coordinating tasks related to their area of focus. Meanwhile, the One Day Director (OD) is responsible for overseeing the logistical aspects of the event or camp, such as scheduling, staffing, and managing the event site.

By distributing decision-making and authority across a team without a single person serving as the head or leader, the MC/OD model can promote a collaborative and efficient team environment where everyone has a voice and can contribute to the success of the event or camp. However, it's important for the team to establish clear communication protocols and decision-making processes to ensure that everyone is on the same page and that issues are resolved quickly and effectively.

Overall, the MC/OD model offers a unique and innovative approach to event or camp management that can lead to more engaged staff and attendees, as well as more successful and well-executed events or camps.
