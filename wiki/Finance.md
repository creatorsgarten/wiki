At Creatorsgarten, we handle finances in a flexible manner, adapting to the needs of each event. This page outlines our approaches to financial management.

# Cashless Events

Most of our events operate on a cashless model:

- Sponsors provide venues, food, and other resources directly.
- No money passes through the organizers.
- This simplifies event organization and reduces financial complexity.

# Events with Financial Transactions

For events that require monetary handling (e.g., [[StupidHackTH|Stupid Hackathon Thailand]]), we employ the following strategies:

## Personal Account Management

- We don't have a central bank account for the collective.
- Event leaders often use their personal bank accounts to receive sponsorship money, although events with a larger team may appoint a dedicated treasury role.
- We recommend organizers create separate savings accounts for Creatorsgarten events to ease reconciliation.
- This approach allows for quick and easy handling of individual sponsorships.
- It's particularly suitable for events with informal sponsorship arrangements.

## Transparency and Balance Tracking

- For some events, we create public balance tracking sheets.
- These sheets show income, expenses, and current balance.
- We used Airtable and Google Sheets in the past, but we also have a new system built on top of [[Grist]] along with a [custom web application](https://github.com/creatorsgarten/GrtnFi) (under development) to streamline the process.
- This allows us to maintain transparency, benefiting sponsors, team members, and future organizers.
- Usage of this system is optional for organizers, as each event leader decides how they want to manage their event's finances.
- These public records align with our [[PublicByDefault|public by default]] principle, promoting transparency and trust within our community. [[PublicByDefault#financial-transparency|See this section for examples]].

## Partnerships with Organizations

- For some events, we partner with established organizations (companies, associations, or non-profits) to handle financial transactions.
- This approach allows for conventional accounting practices, including proper invoicing and receipt issuance.
- It's particularly beneficial for events seeking corporate sponsorships or requiring more formal financial management.
