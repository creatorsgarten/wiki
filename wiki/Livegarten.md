**Livegarten** is an informal guild in Creatorsgarten that helps livestream, record [[videos]], and archive Thai tech event contents.
:::

- **We run the [Creatorsgarten YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@creatorsgarten).** Our videos will be archived there.

# People

Itâ€™s usually these people who livestreams the event:

- {% render 'Person', name: 'rayriffy' %}
- {% render 'Person', name: 'dtinth' %}
- {% render 'Person', name: 'siravijbb' %}
- {% render 'Person', name: 'poom' %}

But we also welcome others to help, so more people knows how to live stream.

# Partnership

We are happy to partnership with other communities who want to livestream and archive their event (subject to our availabilities).
