**Livegarten** is an informal guild in Creatorsgarten that helps livestream, record [[videos]], and archive Thai tech event contents.
:::

- **We run the [Creatorsgarten YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@creatorsgarten).** Our videos will be archived there.

# People

Itâ€™s usually these people who livestreams the event:

- {% render 'Person', name: 'siravijbb' %}
- {% render 'Person', name: 'poom' %}

But we also welcome others to help, so more people knows how to live stream.

We are happy to partner with other communities who want to livestream and archive their event (subject to our availabilities).
