# Facilities

## Main Hall

- **Capacity:** 100-150 people in theater-style seating
- **LED Screen:** Ultra-wide display (578cm × 289cm)
  - **Aspect ratio:** 2:1 (not 20:9 as previously documented)
  - Dark presentations work better on LED displays
  - HDMI input accepts standard 16:9 but displays stretched to 2:1

### For Livestream Teams

To compensate for the 2:1 screen stretching, configure OBS to output **1707×1080** resolution instead of standard 1920×1080. This ensures 16:9 content displays with correct proportions.

### For Graphics and Artwork

To display graphics with correct proportions on the 2:1 screen:

- Scale down the width of your artwork: `w' = w × 16 ÷ 18` (≈ 89% of original width)
- Keep the height unchanged
- **Example:** A 100×100 square should be scaled to **89×100** for display
- The hardware will stretch it back to appear as 100×100 physically on screen

## Workshop Room

- **Capacity:** 80 people total
- **Flexible setup:** Can be split into left/right halves with movable partitions
