# Note to AI secretary:
# How this list works: When we schedule a new event, we add a new item at the end of the list.
# Due to our event format, we don't show the date and place of the next event. Date is simply "Scheduled". Name should be Onsen #N, where N is the next number in the sequence (unless otherwise specified).
# After the event, we update the date and place to the actual date, place, and a URL to the event.

**"My body needs some Onsen…"** Take a break, meet up with great people, or work remotely, with an Onsen pool a few footsteps away!
:::

:::tip[tl;dr:]
Join us and work remotely with boosted productivity and cleanliness, with an Onsen communal bath available a few footsteps away from your workspace.
:::

It is well known that taking a bath improves creativity and problem solving. [Archimedes found his Eureka moment in the bath.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes) Hundreds of people came up with thoughtful ideas in the shower and posted to [r/Showerthoughts](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/new/) every day. ["72% of people get their best ideas in the shower."](https://www.businessinsider.com/why-people-get-their-best-ideas-in-the-shower-2016-1) Taking shower is known to contribute to increased dopamine flow and helps you become more relaxed, [bringing you to the "creative sweet spot".](https://lifehacker.com/science-explains-why-our-best-ideas-come-in-the-shower-5987858)

Furthermore, taking bath makes you feel more fresh and energized. And it promotes good hygiene. Last but not least, the Onsen bath ["promotes muscle pain relief, fatigue alleviation and blood circulation."](https://www.panpuri.com/wellness/onsen-treatment.html)

Unfortunately, most offices don't have Onsen baths. It is a problem that hinders and hampers productivity in workplaces around the world. **Onsen.js** is a lightweight [[informal gatherings|informal gathering]] for people who would like to visit an onsen, socialize, and work remotely.

- **So far, there have been {{ page.meetups | size }} events.** For the list, see [Event list](#event-list).
- **Want to be a part of the next OnsenJS?** See [How to organize](#how-to-organize).
- **For first timers:** I know it can feel quite daunting to take a communal bath with people you've just met! Once you enter the premises, please feel free to proceed to the Onsen pools right away; no need to wait for anyone. We can get to know each other afterwards in the common area! Feel free to join and leave at any time. For example, I might stay until the place closes… or not, depending on situation.

# Event list

:::info[How to join the next event?]
Due to limited working space at the Onsen premises, we use the _friends invite friends_ system. If you know a friend who is going and would like to join, feel free to ask them for an invite. Also, feel free to [organize your own Onsen.js](#how-to-organize), and feel free to invite us!

:::

- **Lobby and work area:** The work area has a USB plug on each seat, and a power outlet is available every 4 seats. There are other seats but they are not ideal for working (you are more likely to get back pain, leaving you worse off).
- **Limited work area seats:** Please feel free to invite your friends, but please bear in mind that the work area has only 10 seats.
- **Wellness bar:** There is a [wellness bar](https://www.facebook.com/GaysornVillage/posts/10157258037773489/) which sells food, drinks and desserts. Thai's favorite menu here is chicken quinoa salad.
- **Pools:** There are 5 pools. From hottest to coldest: Seasonal Onsen, Kusatsu Onsen, Soda Bath, Vitality Pool, Cold Plunge Pool. There is also a Himalayan salt sauna room and a steam room. In addition, there is a small foot bath area.
- **Amenities:** Deodorants, face sprays, body lotions and mouthwash are available for use at the premises.
- **Wellness facilities:** There is a relaxation area where you can take a nap. In the nap room, each chair has its own plug, but that room may not be suitable for work. Free Yoga class available at 6:30 PM sometimes, I guess…?
- **Policies:** Clothing and photo-recording devices are forbidden in the onsen area and grooming/changing area. Only small towel is allowed. You will take out all your clothes during onsen. Please also note that people with full-body tattoos are not allowed into the onsen (by the premises' policy).
- **No re-entry:** If I understand correctly, the day pass only allows a single entrance. That means you may stay in the premises (including the cafe and nap area) for as long as you want until the place closes. But if you exit the premises you can't come back in.
