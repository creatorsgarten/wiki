Creatorsgarten is a loosely connected community of creators. We don't have a formal membership process nor an active online community â€” we connect through shared interests and, of course, events! Here's how to get involved:

# Join our events and connect

- Our [Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/creatorsgarten) is the main channel where we announce upcoming events.
- Check out the [Thai Tech Calendar](https://th.techcal.dev/), a community-driven website listing tech events in Thailand.

# Connect with us

- **During the event:** Chat with organizers and attendees, sharing your interests and asking questions.
- **After the event:** Join a [Bingsu.js](https://bingsu.js.org/), a casual after-party where we continue discussions over food and drinks. They're a great way to connect with fellow creators in a relaxed setting.
- **Express your interest:** Let organizers know if you're interested in helping out with future events. We often invite active community members to our Messenger group, where we coordinate event organization.
