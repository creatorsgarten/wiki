An **informal gathering** (or a **lightweight meetup**) is an [[Events|event]] that requires very little preparation.

- [Bingsu.js](https://bingsu.js.org/), post-meetup after-parties friendly for both introverts and extraverts. It can happen after any event. The mechanic is simple; after a meetup, don’t go home just yet. Stay around for a while. Once most people went back, gather the remaining people and invite them for a meal.

- [[Emkay]], a meetup where we eat at MK Restaurant and talk. This may be a standalone event, or it may be a post-meetup after-party as well.

- [[OnsenJS]], where we work remotely at an onsen place. Usually, these places have a cafe area where we can work. Then we can dip into an onsen pool when you need a break or you have to wait for builds to finish.

- Back in 2017 there were several “CodeClub” events where people just come and code, work on their projects, or learn about something. Then before we all go home, we have a short sharing session where each person shares for a few minutes what they learned or worked on.
