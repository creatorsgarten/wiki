# What to expect?

Teams of participants will race to complete a variety of browser automation challenges using their preferred tools and programming languages. While the event is structured as a contest, our primary focus is on **learning, sharing experiences, and exchanging techniques** with fellow automation enthusiasts.

# How it works

In the event, challenges will be released one-by-one. They are simple web-based challenge that is impossible to complete manually by a human, so teams are expected to automate the browser to solve that challenge. (See below for example challenge.)

In each challenge, the teams that completed it faster will be awarded more points.

After a while (i.e. after we have the first finishers), we will reveal the solution to the challenge (the timing will depend on how quickly teams can solve the challenge), and release the next challenge. The challenge remains available to be solved until the end of the event.

At the event of the event, the points from all rounds are summed up to determine the final ranking, and awards and prizes are given accordingly.

## Example challenge

You can find an example challenge at <https://browser-automation-challenges-demo.netlify.app/>. This challenge may be uninteresting but shows the core mechanics of the event. The challenges at the event will be more challenging, so look forward to it! This video shows one possible solution with Automa:

# Tools and languages

Any programming language or automation tool is welcome, including but not limited to:

- Automa
- Capybara
- Codeception
- Cypress
- Playwright
- Power Automate
- Puppeteer
- Robot Framework
- Selenium
- UiPath
- Watir

Feel free to consult documentation, online resources, or even use AI assistants like ChatGPT, Google Gemini, or Claude to help you tackle the challenges. However, we ask that you do not communicate outside your teams about the problem until the organizers reveal the solution to that problem.

# Who should attend?

This event is ideal for:

- Software development engineers in test (SDET)
- Automated testers
- QA professionals
- RPA specialists
- Web scraping specialists
- Developers and students interested in automation

# Participation

You can join solo or as a team of up to 3 members. The challenges will require a broad skill set, including browser automation, computer science, and creative problem-solving. While problems can be solved collaboratively, each team can only use one computer to complete the challenges.
