# What to expect?

Teams of participants will race to complete a variety of browser automation challenges using their preferred tools and programming languages. While the event is structured as a contest, our primary focus is on **learning, sharing experiences, and exchanging techniques** with fellow automation enthusiasts.

# How it works

Challenges will be released one-by-one. They are simple web-based challenge that is impossible to complete manually by a human, so teams are expected to automate the browser to solve that challenge.

:::details[See challenge example]

This is video of a demo challenge being automated. It is a web form with 3 steps:

1. Type the text into an input field.
2. Check a checkbox.
3. Click a button 15 times.

However, all of that must be done within **5 seconds.** Therefore, automation is needed. See video below:
