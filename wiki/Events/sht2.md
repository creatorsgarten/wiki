# About

Following the tremendous success of [The Stupid Hackathon Bangkok](sht1), we are coming back in The Stupid Hackathon Thailand #2!

**The Stupid Hackathon Thailand** is a 2-day collaborative hackathon in Thailand with no competition or focus on business value whatsoever.

Our main goal for this hackathon is to get developers to just _have fun_ and learn together, through working on any project they want, fostering a community of enthusiastic makers.

This hackathon is [held all around the world](https://gist.github.com/cheeaun/c3fe6cbb11aef1e146a3474dccf63b87), including New York (the original), San Francisco, Rhode Island, Canada, Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Norway, Hawaii, UK, Shanghai, Singapore, andâ€¦ here, Thailand! In spirit of the stupid hackathons worldwide, this event is _non-commercial_ and free to attend.
