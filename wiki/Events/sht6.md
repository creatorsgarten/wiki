(Stying as **The ៦th Stupid Hackathon in Thailand**)

**The Stupid Hackathon in Thailand** is a collaborative hackathon in Thailand with non-competitive intentions and no focuses on business value.

Our main goal for this hackathon is to get makers to just _have fun_ and learn together, through working on any project they can dream of, fostering a community of enthusiastic creators.

The stupid hackathon is [held all around the world](https://gist.github.com/cheeaun/c3fe6cbb11aef1e146a3474dccf63b87), including New York (the original), San Francisco, Rhode Island, Canada, Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Norway, Hawaii, UK, Shanghai, Singapore, and… here, Thailand! In the spirit of the stupid hackathons worldwide, this event is _non-commercial_ and free to attend.
