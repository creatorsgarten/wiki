# About

Following the tremendous success of [The Stupid Hackathon Thailand #3](sht3), we are coming back to The Stupid Hackathon Thailand #4!

**The Stupid Hackathon Thailand** is a collaborative hackathon in Thailand with no competition or focuses on business value whatsoever.

Our main goal for this hackathon is to get developers to just _have fun_ and learn together, through working on any project they can dream of, fostering a community of enthusiastic makers.

The stupid hackathon is [held all around the world](https://gist.github.com/cheeaun/c3fe6cbb11aef1e146a3474dccf63b87), including New York (the original), San Francisco, Rhode Island, Canada, Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Norway, Hawaii, UK, Shanghai, Singapore, andâ€¦ here, Thailand! In the spirit of the stupid hackathons worldwide, this event is _non-commercial_ and free to attend.
