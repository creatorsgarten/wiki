Following [the](https://blog.rayriffy.com/review-the-stupid-hackathon-th-2/) [tremendous](https://medium.com/teamappman/มาเล่างาน-the-stupid-hackathon-thailand-2-ให้อ่านกันค่ะ-a6310bbe47e4) [success](https://gitlab.com/StupidHackTH/3/wikis/StupidHackTH2-Feedback) of [The Stupid Hackathon Thailand #2](sht2), we are coming back in The Stupid Hackathon Thailand #3!

**The Stupid Hackathon Thailand** is a 2-day collaborative hackathon in Thailand with no competition or focus on business value whatsoever.

Our main goal for this hackathon is to get developers to just _have fun_ and learn together, through working on any project they want, fostering a community of enthusiastic makers.

This hackathon is [held all around the world](https://gist.github.com/cheeaun/c3fe6cbb11aef1e146a3474dccf63b87), including New York (the original), San Francisco, Rhode Island, Canada, Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Norway, Hawaii, UK, Shanghai, Singapore, and… here, Thailand! In spirit of the stupid hackathons worldwide, this event is _non-commercial_ and free to attend.
