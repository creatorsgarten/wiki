# Layout

We have 2 modes of layout:

1. **Banner:** The presenter screen and camera feed is put next to each other, and a 120px banner is displayed at the bottom.

2. **Frame:** The presenter screen and camera feed is placed on the canvas, then an image is overlaid on top to produce the final picture.

2. **Camera and screen** when there’s an ongoing presentation, with various aspect ratios:

    - **16:9** (recommended)
    - 16:10 (optional)
