When [[Livegarten]] livestreams or records an event, we request the organizers to prepare some image assets for us.
:::

There are

- **Layout images** for placing with the screen and camera feed.
- **Intermission images** for displayed before stream starts and during intermissions.

# Layout

We have 2 modes of layout:

1. **Banner:** The presenter screen and camera feed is put next to each other, and a 120px banner is displayed at the bottom.

2. **Frame:** The presenter screen and camera feed is placed on the canvas, then an image is overlaid on top to produce the final picture.

# Banner layout

Please prepare for us a **1920×120** image to use as a banner.

## Frame images

We request 2 frame images:

1. **Camera feed only** when no presentation is active.

2. **Camera and screen** when there’s an ongoing presentation, with various aspect ratios:

    - **16:9** (recommended)
    - 16:10 (optional)

# Intermission images

Intermissions are shown when we are not showing either the camera or the screen. There are 2 ways:

- **You can provide us images beforehand.** We will show them at an appropriate time. You can also provide us a transparent PNG, which we can overlay on top of camera feed (see examples below).

- **You can provide live HDMI video feed to show.** If you have a spare laptop, you can use it to show intermission images, and we will mirror it to livestream.
