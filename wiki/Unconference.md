An **unconference** is a loosely structured conference where the agenda is created by the participants at the event. Unlike traditional conferences with pre-planned schedules and speakers, unconferences allow attendees to propose and lead sessions on topics they are passionate about or interested in discussing.

**BarCamp** is one of the most well-known unconference formats that has been widely adopted in Thailand. The first BarCamp was held in Palo Alto, California, in 2005, and the concept quickly spread globally, including to Thailand.
