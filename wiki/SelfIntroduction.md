**Creatorsgarten** is a collective of [[people]], both professionals and students, who share a passion for discovering and creating new things. Since 2017, we have collaborated with a diverse group of fascinating people, including open-source communities, developers, educators, artists, and more, to explore new possibilities and co-create exciting projects together.

We have crafted [open-source](https://github.com/creatorsgarten) projects, advocated for innovative ideas within communities, and hosted over [{{eventCount}} community events](/events), which include meetups, hackathons, camps, and contests. More than 1,200 people have attended our events, and over 6,000 people follow us on [Facebook](https://grtn.org/fb). All of our events are free, thanks to the generous support of our sponsors and partners.
